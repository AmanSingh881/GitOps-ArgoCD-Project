# Jenkins CI Pipeline with SonarQube, OWASP Dependency Check, AWS ECR, and AWS Secrets Manager

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Jenkins CI pipeline** that automates the process of building, analyzing, securing, and deploying a Dockerized application to **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**.  

The pipeline includes:
- **GitHub Source Integration** ‚Äì Pulls the application code from GitHub.  
- **Static Code Analysis with SonarQube** ‚Äì Ensures code quality and maintainability.  
- **Dependency Scanning with OWASP Dependency-Check** ‚Äì Identifies vulnerable dependencies.  
- **Docker Image Build** ‚Äì Builds a container image from the application code.  
- **Image Push to AWS ECR** ‚Äì Securely pushes the built image to AWS ECR.  
- **Helm Chart Automation** ‚Äì Updates Helm values.yaml with the new image tag.
- **Pull Request Creation in GitHub** ‚Äì Creates a PR for deployment automation.
- **Secrets Management with AWS Secrets Manager** ‚Äì Stores sensitive information such as AWS 
credentials, repository URIs, and other Jenkins secrets securely.  
- **Post-Build Cleanup** ‚Äì Removes unused images from Jenkins agent to save space.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Workflow
![Pipeline Flow](Assets/CIworkflow.png)  

1. **Checkout Code**  
   - Clones the source code from GitHub (`main` branch).

2. **Static Code Analysis (SonarQube)**  
   - Runs `sonar-scanner` with project-specific details.  
   - Ensures code adheres to quality and reliability standards.  

3. **Quality Gate Check**
   - Waits for SonarQube Quality Gate result.
   - If quality gate fails (too many issues, low coverage), pipeline aborts.

4. **Dependency Security Check (OWASP)**  
   - Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities.  
   - Generates security reports.
   - Enable SonarQube **Quality Gate** stage (currently commented in pipeline).  

5. **Docker Image Build**  
   - Builds the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`.  

6. **Push to AWS ECR**  
   - Authenticates with AWS ECR using `aws ecr get-login-password`.  
   - Tags the image correctly and pushes it to the AWS ECR repository.  

7. **Update Helm Chart & Create Pull Request**
   - Clones the repository again into a `featurebranch` branch.
   - Updates the Helm `values.yaml` file with the new image tag.
   - Commits and pushes the changes.
   - Creates a `Pull Request` in GitHub targeting the `main` branch.
   - Ensures deployments always pick up the latest image tag.

8. **Cleanup**  
   - Removes local Docker images and prunes unused layers.

## üöÄ Running the Pipeline
1. Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository.  
2. In Jenkins, create a new pipeline project and point it to this repository.  
3. Add required secrets in **AWS Secrets Manager**, and configure Jenkins to fetch them dynamically.  
4. Run the pipeline and provide `DEPLOY_VERSION` when prompted.  
5. Verify:
   1. Docker image in AWS ECR
   2. Pull Request created in GitHub with updated Helm values

## üìä Security & Quality Tools
- **SonarQube**: Helps maintain clean, safe, and reliable code.  
- **OWASP Dependency-Check**: Detects security vulnerabilities in project dependencies.  
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Protects sensitive data by avoiding plain text credentials in Jenkins.  

---

## üßπ Cleanup Policy
After every build, the pipeline automatically:
- Removes local Docker images built during the pipeline run.  
- Prunes unused Docker layers to free disk space.  

---

## üìå Future Enhancements
- Add automated deployment to AWS ECS or Kubernetes (EKS).  
- Add email or Slack notifications for build results.
