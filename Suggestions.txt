I checked the GitOps-ArgoCD-Project. Itâ€™s a solid setup showing how Jenkins and ArgoCD can automate Kubernetes deployments using Git as the source of truth. The project works well, but here are a few suggestions:

Improve the README with clear setup instructions and usage examples.

Organize code and configs consistently, remove unnecessary comments, spaces, and consoles, and reuse components where possible.

Avoid hardcoding credentials; use environment variables or secrets.

Consider adding automated tests, rollback options, and notifications for the pipeline.

Add contribution guidelines and track improvements with GitHub Issues.

Overall, the project is good; these changes would make it cleaner, easier to maintain, and more user-friendly.
